## Architecture

![Architecture](resources/Architecture.png)


## Install

### Ubuntu/Debian

* Install the repository information and associated GPG key (to ensure authenticity):
```
echo "deb http://dl.bintray.com/geldtech/debian /" |  tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/geld-tech.list
apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com EA3E6BAEB37CF5E4
```

* Update repository list of available packages and clean already installed versions
```
apt clean all
apt update
```

* Install package
```
apt install pictures-annotation-service
```

### CentOS/Red Hat

* Install the repository by creating the file /etc/yum.repos.d/zlig.repo:
```
echo "[geld.tech]
name=geld.tech
baseurl=http://dl.bintray.com/geldtech/rpm
gpgcheck=0
repo_gpgcheck=0
enabled=1" |  tee -a /etc/yum.repos.d/geld.tech.repo
```

* Install EPEL repository for external dependencies
```
yum install epel-release
```

* Install the package
```
yum install pictures-annotation-service
```

### Docker

Installation on Docker is similar to the base image, CentOS or Ubuntu, but with the following differences pre-requisites.

* Install Python and wget (if not installed yet)
  * CentOS-based image: `yum install -y python wget`
  * Ubuntu-based image: `apt update && apt install -y python wget`
* Download Docker systemctl replacement
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gdraheim/docker-systemctl-replacement/master/files/docker/systemctl.py
```
* Replace systemctl (which doesn't work on Docker as PIDs aren't starting at 1):
```
cp /usr/bin/systemctl /usr/bin/systemctl.bak
yes | cp -f systemctl.py /usr/bin/systemctl
chmod a+x /usr/bin/systemctl
test -L /bin/systemctl || ln -sf /usr/bin/systemctl /bin/systemctl
```


## Usage

* Adds Google Analytics User Agent ID (optional)
  * Create configuration if doesn't exist
```
cp  /opt/geld/webapps/pictures-annotation-service/config/settings.cfg.template /opt/geld/webapps/pictures-annotation-service/config/settings.cfg
```

  * Edit configuration file
```
vim /opt/geld/webapps/pictures-annotation-service/config/settings.cfg
```

  * Replace <GA_UA_ID> with own value
```
[ganalytics]
ua_id=<GA_UA_ID>
```

* Reload systemd services configuration and start pictures-annotation-service service
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start pictures-annotation-service
systemctl status pictures-annotation-service
```


## Development

Use the Makefile targets from the provided Makefile to build and run locally the Flask server with API, a stub Nginx status, and the Vue web application with DevTools enabled for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vue-js-devtools/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd):

```
# Build application
make all

# Run application locally
make start
```

Then, access the application locally using a browser at the address: [http://0.0.0.0:5000/](http://0.0.0.0:5000/).

Type `make stop` at any stage to stop the local development application.
